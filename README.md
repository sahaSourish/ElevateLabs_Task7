## Basic Sales Summary using Python and SQLite

This project is part of the data analyst internship task. The goal was to create a small SQLite database, run simple SQL queries using Python, and show the results both through print statements and visualizations.

## What I Did

- Created a sales database from scratch using SQLite
- Inserted sample sales data for different fruits
- Wrote SQL queries to calculate total quantity and revenue per product
- Displayed the results using pandas
- Visualized revenue by product using a bar chart
- Explored the data further with extra queries like daily revenue and average prices

## Tools Used

- Python  
 - SQLite (built-in with Python)  
 - Pandas  
 - Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- Apple had the highest total revenue among all products
- Mango had fewer sales but a higher price per unit
- Most sales occurred across three main days
- Revenue and quantity data could be grouped easily using SQL's GROUP BY
- Extra queries helped find average prices, sales per date, and filtered product data

## Dataset Used

- There was no external dataset used
- All sample data was manually created and inserted into the database inside the Python script

## Folder Contents

- `main.ipynb` – the notebook with all Python code and visual output
- `SQL Queries.pdf` – contains all SQL queries and their output
- `sales_data.db` – the SQLite database file created during the task
- `README.md` – this file

## What I Learned

- How to connect a Python program to a SQLite database
- Writing basic but powerful SQL queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, SUM, AVG, and WHERE
- How to read query results into pandas DataFrames
- The importance of simple visualizations to explain data
- Practiced organizing, analyzing, and presenting data clearly
